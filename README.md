# TitanTech

This repo records and holds all the research and data regarding the ** titan unmanned mission **
The mission started off as a completely aerial exploration based solution due to Titan's favourable atmospheric charactersitics, but has since moved on to a duo of mobile rover and a multicopter drone, so as to ensure not all the weight is carried by the drone, and yet a large area can be covered.

As of 25th September, research into scientific instrumentation, geographic areas of interest, GPS denied navigation, and long-term swarm based path planning is being conducted.
Mission details and research paper analyses along with finalized public google doc links will be gradually added to the README.md, all code and CAD will be added to the repo. 

We hope to take this to NASAs NIAC program. And function as a central source for Titan related information.
